My name is Nick Perkins, and this is my personal blog. This is where I come to jot down my thoughts on things that interest me, like cloud computing, infrastructure as code, Kubernetes, platform engineering, motorsport... I guess nothing much is off limits.

I currently work for Domino's Pizza Enterprises (DPE) as Principal DevOps Engineer, as the Tech Lead on the Platform Foundation team. I help drive the adoption of Platform Engineering culture at DPE, and work with stakeholders across Cloud Engineering, Architecture, Software Engineering and more to strive. I run fortnightly DevOps brown bag sessions to help build a community of engineers who embrace and share better engineering practices. 

Before joining DPE, I was a Senior DevOps Engineer at Hutly, and a Software Engineer at Arkose Labs.

I have more than twelve years of experience as a software engineer, plus experience in business analysis, project management and team leadership. Before that, I worked in financial administration and assets management within the public sector for over seven years.

What to some people may look like a weird path to travel has allowed me to develop a bunch of soft skills to go along with my technical skills.

I love problem-solving, learning, and digging into the meat of the issue.

When not inside getting a screen tan, I am a volunteer motorsport official. I have been an official since 2015, working in many areas such as flagging, paddock marshaling, and track marshaling. Since 2023, I have moved into timekeeping which has seen me quickly progress into senior roles, such as chief timekeeper for support categories at the Gold Coast 500 in 2024.

He is wearing a dull-green GitHub cap with a radio headset over it, dark sunglasses, a bright orange hi-vis short and a lanyard around his neck holding a whistle. He looks very official!" >}}I love being a motorsport official!{{< /imgproc >}}

This has seen me work alongside other experienced officials to build a volunteer group named [GP Timers](https://gptimers.com.au) for timekeepers in South East Queensland. We hope to provide a safe and fun environment for people to learn timekeeping at circuit events and find an outlet for their passion.  

Alternatively, I'll be found at home with my wife [Natalie](https://definatalie.com) and doggo Lucy.
