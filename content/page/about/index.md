I am a software engineer, a devops engineer, a problem solver and just generally a bit of a geek.  

I am currently working to build highly-available, zero downtime, distributed software systems to help combat fraud. I have over eleven years of experience as a software engineer, and previously worked in financial administration. I love problem solving, and using my ability to adapt and learn to find the right solutions.

When not at a desk coding, I am a volunteer motorsport official. You'll find me standing trackside whenever I can find the time. Alternatively I'll be found at home with my wife [Natalie](https://fancyladyindustries.com) and doggo Lucy.

Oh, and you can call me Nick!
